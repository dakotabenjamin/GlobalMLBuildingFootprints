## Introduction

Bing Maps is releasing open building footprints around the world. We have detected **777M** buildings from Bing Maps imagery between 2014 and 2021 including Maxar and Airbus imagery. The data is freely available for download and use under ODbL. This dataset complements our [other releases](#will-there-be-more-data-coming-for-other-geographies).

### What is the GeoJSON format?
GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. 
For intensive documentation and tutorials, refer to this [blog](http://geojson.org/).

### Why is the data being released?
Microsoft has a continued interest in supporting a thriving OpenStreetMap ecosystem.

### Should we import the data into OpenStreetMap?
Maybe. Never overwrite the hard work of other contributors or blindly import data into OSM without first checking the local quality. While our metrics show that this data meets or exceeds the quality of hand-drawn building footprints, the data does vary in quality from place to place, between rural and urban, mountains and plains, and so on. Inspect quality locally and discuss an import plan with the community. Always follow the [OSM import community guidelines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines).

### Will the data be used or made available in the larger OpenStreetMap ecosystem?
Yes. The [HOT Tasking Manager](https://tasks.hotosm.org) has integrated Facebook [RapiD](https://mapwith.ai/rapid#background=Bing&disable_features=boundaries&map=2.00/0.0/0.0) where the data has been made available. 

### How did we create the data?
The building extraction is done in two stages:
1.	Semantic Segmentation – Recognizing building pixels on an aerial image using deep neural networks (DNNs)
2.	Polygonization – Converting building pixel detections into polygons

#### Stage1: Semantic Segmentation
![segmenation diagram](images/segmentation.jpg)

#### Stage 2: Polygonization
![polygonization diagram](images/polygonization.jpg)

### Were there any modeling improvements used for this release? 
We did not apply any modeling improvements for this release. Instead, we focused on scaling our approach to increase coverage, and trained models regionally.  

### Evaluation set metrics
The evaluation metrics are computed on a set of building polygon labels for each region. Note, we only have verification results for 
Mexico buildings since we did not train a model for the country. 

Building match metrics on the evaluation set:

| Region          | Precision   | Recall   |
|:----------------:|:------------:|:---------:|
| Africa          | 94.4%       | 70.9%    |
| Caribbean      | 92.2%       | 76.8%    |
| Central Asia    | 97.17%      | 79.47%   |
| Europe          | 94.3%       | 85.9%    |
| Middle East     | 95.7%       | 85.4%    |
| South America   | 95.4%       | 78.0%    |
| South Asia      | 94.8%       | 76.7%    |




We track the following metrics to measure the quality of matched building polygons in the evaluation set:
1. Intersection over Union – This is a standard metric measuring the overlap quality against the labels
2. Dominant angle rotation error – This measures the polygon rotation deviation

| Region          | IoU    |   Rotation error [deg] |
|:----------------:|:-------:|:-----------------------:|
| Africa          | 64.5%  |                   5.67 |
| Caribbean      | 64.0%  |                   6.64 |
| Central Asia    | 68.2%  |                   6.91 |
| Europe          | 65.1%  |                  10.28 |
| Middle East     | 65.1%  |                   9.3  |
| South America   | 66.7%  |                   6.34 |
| South Asia      | 63.1%  |                   6.25 |



### False positive ratio in the corpus

False positives are estimated per country from randomly sampled building polygon predictions.

| Region | Buildings Sampled | False Positive Rate | 
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Africa | 5,000 | 1.1% |
| Caribbean | 3,000 | 1.8% |
| Central Asia | 3,000 | 2.2% |
| Europe | 5,000 | 1.4% |
| Mexico | 2,000 | 0.1% |
| Middle East | 7,000 | 1.8% |
| South America | 5,000 | 1.7% |
| South Asia | 7,000 | 1.4% |


### What is the vintage of this data?
Vintage of extracted building footprints depends on the vintage of the underlying imagery. The underlying imagery is from Bing Maps including Maxar and Airbus between 2014 and 2021.

### How good is the data?
Our metrics show that in the vast majority of cases the quality is at least as good as hand digitized buildings in OpenStreetMap. It is not perfect, particularly in dense urban areas but it provides good recall in rural areas.

### What is the coordinate reference system?
EPSG: 4326

### Will there be more data coming for other geographies?
Maybe. This is a work in progress. Also, check out our other building releases!
